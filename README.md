# RRTMGP

We are rewriting the RRTMGP cloud code, and I figured it wouldn't hurt to do this separate designing and coding in a different version control repo. The original, untouched cloud code with Robert Pincus notes are in mo_cloud_optics_pade.F90, and my revisions will be written in pernak_mo_cloud_optics_pade.F90.
